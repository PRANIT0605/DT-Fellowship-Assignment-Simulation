Prompt: 
You are writing a cold outbound email to the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of a mid-sized pharmaceutical company that is struggling with operational inefficiencies — such as delayed order processing, fragmented data systems, or inventory mismatch.

Structure the email using the AIDCA framework:
- *Attention*: Start by identifying a common operational frustration for pharma SMEs (e.g., delayed FDA compliance, batch tracking errors).
- *Interest*: Mention how modern pharma-specific workflow automation or digital tools can address these problems.
- *Desire*: Highlight precise business benefits such as reduced compliance errors, faster order cycles, or traceable batch history.
- *Conviction*: Add proof elements — client results, improved delivery speed metrics, or regulatory audit pass rates.
- *Action*: End with a CTA like a 20-minute consultation, free demo, or operations audit offer.

Include the following persuasion principles:
- *Scarcity*: Mention that only 3 slots are available for onboarding this quarter, due to regulatory capacity limits.
- *Authority*: Reference recognized pharma clients or industry compliance standards we’ve helped companies meet.

 Negative Instructions:
- Avoid casual or salesy tone — this is for a COO who values precision and process.
- Do not exceed 400 words.
- Avoid technical jargon that a non-technical executive may find confusing — keep it business-impact focused.

## Main Purpose Of the Prompt:

The prompt asks for:
- A cold email template aimed at Chief Operating Officers in mid-sized pharmaceutical companies
- Selling a pharma-specific workflow/compliance platform that addresses operational inefficiencies
- Focusing on pain points like batch tracking errors, inventory mismatches, compliance delays, and order processing issues
- Including specific metrics and social proof to build credibility
- Ending with a call-to-action for a consultation or audit
- The prompt is essentially a B2B sales copywriting exercise - asking an AI to craft a persuasive outreach email that would be used by a software company or consultant to generate leads in the pharmaceutical industry.
